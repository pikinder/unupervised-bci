# unupervised-bci
This repository contains code implementing an unsupervised decoder for Event-Related Potential based Brain-Computer Interfaces. 

## Usage
 1. Download and preprocess the data by running __setup.sh__
 2. run an _experiment*.py_ script

## Datasets used
 1. The data from the AMUSE paradigm by Schreuder et al.
 
## Implemented experiments
### Amuse Batch

## Code was tested using:
 * python 2.7.12
 * sklearn 0.18.1
 * numpy 1.12.1
 * scipy 0.19.0
 
## Work in progress
 * Inclusion of a script to simulate an online experiment
 * Inclusion of a transfer learning script
 * Inclusion of a script to compare to supervised evaluation
 * Inclusion of Learning from Label Proportions
